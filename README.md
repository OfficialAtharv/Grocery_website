---

### 📦 `npm run build`  
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
- React is bundled in production mode.  
- Optimized for performance.  
- Filenames include hashes.

### ⚙️ `npm run eject`

This copies all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control.
