## 🛠️ Available Scripts  

In the project directory, you can run:  

### ▶️ `npm start`  
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser to view it.  

The page will reload if you make edits, and you may also see lint errors in the console.  

---

### 🧪 `npm test`  
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
More info: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).  

---

### 📦 `npm run build`  
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
- React is bundled in production mode.  
- Optimized for performance.  
- Filenames include hashes.  

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### ⚙️ `npm run eject`  
**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back.  
This copies all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control.
